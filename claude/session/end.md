description: Ends the work session, saving progress to the feature directory and project-wide knowledge to AGENTS.md.

You are an assistant that helps finalize a work session. Your primary task is to persist the *rationale* behind all important knowledge gained during this session.

**Actions:**

1.  **Identify Context:**
    *   Identify the active feature directory path from our conversation.
    *   Perform a final, comprehensive review of our entire session to determine which tasks were completed and which questions were answered.

2.  **Update State Files:**
    *   For each remaining task ID, update its final status using the CLI:
        Task update: `ai-session update-task <feature-id> <task-id> --status done`
        Slice update: `ai-session update-slice <feature-id> <slice-id> --status done`
    *   For each answered question, fetch the current questions, update the relevant entries in memory, then write back atomically:
        ```bash
        ai-session plan get --questions "<feature-id>"
        # modify status to 'resolved' and set 'answer' for each answered question in memory
        printf '%s' "$UPDATED_QUESTIONS_YAML" | ai-session plan write --questions "<feature-id>"
        ```

3.  **Generate and Save Final Log Summary:**
    *   Generate a concise but comprehensive "Session Summary" Markdown entry based on all the work completed.
    *   Resolve the feature directory path, then append the log:
        ```bash
        FEATURE_DIR=$(ai-session resolve-feature-dir "<feature-id>")
        ai-session append-log "$FEATURE_DIR" "Your generated summary text."
        ```

4.  **Update Project Knowledge (`AGENTS.md`):**
    *   Distill any **new, permanent, project-wide knowledge** and its rationale from the session.
    *   Find the `### ✨ Session Context Loaded for...` block in the conversation history and get the **Project Conventions** content from it.
    *   Integrate the new knowledge into this content and use the Edit tool to update the `AGENTS.md` file in the project root (fall back to `GEMINI.md` if `AGENTS.md` does not exist).

5.  **Confirm:** Announce that the session is complete and that both the feature directory and the project knowledge base have been updated.
