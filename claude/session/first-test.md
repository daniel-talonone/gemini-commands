description: Creates integration tests for the feature's acceptance criteria. Mocks only external services; all internal components run as real code. Tests are expected to fail initially (TDD red phase). Build and lint must pass.
---

You are a senior engineer writing the first tests for a feature before implementation begins. The goal is to anchor the work in observable, behaviour-level expectations — derived directly from acceptance criteria — before any code is written.

This is a **TDD red phase**:
- Test logic must fail (assertions fail because the feature isn't implemented yet)
- Build and lint must pass (the test file is valid, compilable, and clean)

If a test fails to compile or lint, fix it before moving on — a broken build is not a red phase, it's a broken state.

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Mock only external service boundaries**: HTTP clients, database drivers, third-party provider classes. Everything else — routing, handlers, utilities, domain logic — must run as real code.
- **One assertion per test**: Each test has one clear intent. Prefer many small tests over one large test.
- **Name tests after behaviour, not code**: `'applies item-level discount only to the targeted item'`, not `'getCheckoutItemPrice with breakdown'`.
- **Tests must map to acceptance criteria**: Trace each test back to a specific AC item. Add a comment above each test citing which AC it covers.
- **Assert what is observable from outside**: Check the data sent to external services, not internal state or intermediate function calls.

## Language Support

Detect the project language by checking the root for `go.mod` (Go), `package.json` (TypeScript/JavaScript), or other language markers. Apply the conventions for that language below. If the language is not listed, infer the closest equivalent conventions and document your assumptions in a comment at the top of the test file.

### TypeScript / JavaScript

| Concern | Convention |
|---|---|
| Test file name | `<handler>.integration.test.ts`, co-located with the handler |
| Test runner | Jest (or whatever `AGENTS.md` specifies) |
| Mocking | `jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(...)` |
| Mock reset | `beforeEach(() => jest.clearAllMocks())` |
| Factory pattern | `const make<Thing> = (overrides?: Partial<T>): T => ({ ...defaults, ...overrides })` |
| Run scoped tests | `<test-command> --testPathPattern="<file>"` |
| Build check | `tsc --noEmit` or the project's build command |
| Lint check | `eslint` or the project's lint command (with `--fix` if configured) |

### Go

| Concern | Convention |
|---|---|
| Test file name | `<handler>_integration_test.go`, co-located with the handler |
| Test runner | `go test` |
| Mocking | Interfaces — define a minimal interface for each external dependency and pass a fake struct in tests |
| Factory pattern | `func make<Thing>(t *testing.T, overrides ...func(*Thing)) *Thing` |
| Run scoped tests | `go test ./path/to/pkg/... -run TestFunctionName` |
| Build check | `go build ./...` |
| Lint check | `golangci-lint run` or the project's lint command |

> **Adding a new language:** Add a row to this table with the same columns. Keep conventions specific — avoid generic advice.

## Process

### 1. Load Context

Find the `### ✨ Session Context Loaded for...` block in the conversation history. Extract:
- The **feature ID** (from the block title)
- The **Acceptance Criteria** (from the Description)

Resolve the feature directory:
```bash
FEATURE_DIR="$(ai-session resolve-feature-dir "<feature-id>")"
echo "$FEATURE_DIR"
```

Read `description.md` from that directory to get the full acceptance criteria if not already in context.

### 2. Explore the Codebase

Use Glob and Grep to identify:

- The **project language** (check for `go.mod`, `package.json`, etc.)
- The **entry point** the feature touches (handler, route, service)
- The **external service boundaries** — classes, interfaces, or modules that make HTTP calls or DB queries (these are the only things to mock)
- **Existing test files** for the same handler or module — read them to understand the mocking and factory patterns already in use
- The **verification command** from `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` in the project root — this is the command to run after writing tests

### 3. Design the Test File

Before writing a single line, plan the tests as a mapping:

| AC item | Test name | Input | What to assert | What to mock |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AC 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| AC 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Think about:
- What does the entry point receive as input?
- What observable output does it produce? (usually: what arguments were passed to the mocked external service)
- Which edge cases and fallback behaviors are mentioned in the ACs?

### 4. Write the Test File

Use the conventions from the Language Support table above.

The file header must state:
- Which external services are mocked
- Which internal components are deliberately kept real
- Which ACs are covered

```
// Integration tests for <feature>.
//
// Mocked (external boundaries): <list>
// Real (internal components):   <list>
//
// AC coverage: AC1, AC2, AC3, ...
```

Factory rules:
- Minimal — include only fields required for the test to make sense
- Accept partial overrides — callers set only what is relevant to their test
- No shared mutable state between tests

Mock rules:
- Mock at the boundary, not inside the logic
- Assert on the arguments passed to the mock (what was sent out), not on call counts unless idempotency is explicitly required by an AC

### 5. Verify: Build and Lint First

Before running tests, run the build and lint checks for the project language. **Do not proceed to step 6 if either fails.**

For TypeScript:
```bash
tsc --noEmit 2>&1
```
For Go:
```bash
go build ./... 2>&1
```

Then run the lint command from `AGENTS.md`. If the verification command already includes build and lint, run it directly.

**If build or lint fails:**
- Read the error output carefully
- Fix the issue in the test file (type errors, unused imports, lint violations)
- Re-run until clean
- Do not accept `// @ts-ignore` or `//nolint` suppressions unless they were already present in the codebase for the same reason

### 6. Run the Tests

Run scoped to the new file using the command from the Language Support table:

```bash
<scoped-test-command> 2>&1 | tail -40
```

Expected outcome:
- **New tests**: all fail (assertions fail, not compile errors)
- **Existing tests**: all still pass

**If a new test unexpectedly passes:**
- Check whether the feature is already partially implemented
- Check whether the test is asserting a trivial or vacuous condition (e.g. asserting something that would be true regardless)
- Fix the test or remove it — a passing test in the red phase is a false signal

**If an existing test breaks:**
- Your factories or mocks are likely leaking state
- Isolate the issue and fix it before proceeding

### 7. Report

Print a table:

| Test | Status | AC | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<test name>` | ✕ failing (expected) | AC 2 | Covers item-level discount |
| `<test name>` | ✓ passing | — | Covers existing fallback behaviour |

If any new test passes unexpectedly, flag it clearly with the reason.

### 8. Checkpoint

Run `/session:checkpoint` to save progress.
