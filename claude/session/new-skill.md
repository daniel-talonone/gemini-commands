description: Creates a new session skill by learning from existing skills and the ai-session CLI. The result is a well-structured .md file under ~/.claude/commands/session/.
---

You are a meta-skill author. Your job is to draft a new skill file that fits naturally into the existing skill ecosystem. The output is a single Markdown file — precise, consistent with the other skills, and grounded in what the tooling actually supports.

---

## Core Principle: CLI First

Before writing a single step that touches the feature directory, run:

```bash
ai-session --help 2>&1
```

Then, for every subcommand that could be relevant to the skill being built, run:

```bash
ai-session <subcommand> --help 2>&1
```

**If an operation is available through the CLI, the skill must use the CLI — never access the file directly.** Direct file access (Read tool, `yq`, `cat`) is only acceptable when no CLI command exists for that operation. Document this gap with a comment in the skill, e.g.:

```
# No CLI command yet — reading review.yml directly until `ai-session review-get` exists
```

This keeps skills forward-compatible: when a new CLI command is added, the gap comment makes it easy to find and upgrade.

---

## Process

### 1. Gather the Skill Specification

The user provides a skill name (e.g. `my-skill`) and a brief description of what it should do. If either is missing, ask before proceeding.

### 2. Read the Existing Skill Ecosystem

Read a representative sample of existing skills to internalize structural conventions:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/commands/session/
```

Then read at least 3 skills that are structurally similar to the one being built (e.g. if the new skill involves a sub-agent, read `review.md`; if it involves state updates, read `checkpoint.md`; if it involves TDD, read `first-test.md`; if it involves feedback triage, read `address-local-feedback.md`).

Look for:
- Frontmatter format (`description:` field only, no other keys)
- How context is loaded from the conversation (the `### ✨ Session Context Loaded` block)
- How the feature directory is resolved (`ai-session resolve-feature-dir`)
- Whether the skill delegates to a sub-agent or runs inline
- How steps are numbered and named
- How the skill ends (always with `/session:checkpoint` unless it IS the checkpoint)

### 3. Audit the CLI

Run `ai-session --help` and check every subcommand that could be relevant. For each operation the skill needs to perform, determine:

| Operation | CLI command | Direct file access? |
|---|---|---|
| Append to log | `ai-session append-log <dir> "<message>"` | No |
| Read plan | `ai-session plan-get <dir> --slice <id>` | No |
| Update task status | `ai-session update-task ...` | No |
| Read review findings | *(no CLI yet)* | Yes — read `review*.yml` directly |
| ... | ... | ... |

### 4. Draft the Skill

Write the skill file following this structure:

```markdown
---
description: <one-line description — shown in skill listings>
---

<Role sentence: "You are a ... Your job is to ...">

---

## [Optional: Core Principles]

<Any non-obvious rules that govern this skill's behaviour. Skip if trivial.>

---

## Process

### 1. Load Context
<How to get the feature ID and feature dir from the session context block>

### 2-N. <Named Steps>
<Each step has a clear goal, the exact bash commands to run (using the CLI where available), and the decision logic>

### Last Step. Checkpoint
Run `/session:checkpoint` to save progress.
```

Rules:
- Steps must be **numbered and named**, not bulleted
- Bash commands must be **exact and runnable** — no pseudocode
- Where a CLI command is used, show the exact invocation with argument placeholders
- Where direct file access is unavoidable, add the gap comment
- The skill must end with `/session:checkpoint` (unless the skill itself is a state-management primitive like `checkpoint.md`)

### 5. Present for Approval

Show the full draft to the user. Do not write the file yet.

Explain:
- Which operations use the CLI and which access files directly (and why)
- Any structural choices that deviate from the existing skills (and why)

### 6. Write the File

Only after the user approves, write the file to:

```
~/.claude/commands/session/<skill-name>.md
```

Confirm the path and that the file was written.
