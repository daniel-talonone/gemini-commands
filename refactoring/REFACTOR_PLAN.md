# Refactoring Plan: Migrating to Helper Scripts

## Goal

To improve the reliability and determinism of the session commands by migrating procedural, deterministic logic out of LLM prompts and into dedicated, executable helper scripts.

## Architectural Rationale (The "Why")

The core philosophy of this project is to use robust, deterministic tools for state updates and procedural tasks, reserving the LLM for creative and synthesis-based tasks. We identified that asking the LLM to perform multi-step procedures (e.g., creating a directory, then creating multiple files inside it) is brittle. The LLM is non-deterministic and can fail, misinterpret, or forget steps, leading to inconsistent command execution.

This refactoring effort is a direct continuation of the project's architectural evolution:
1.  **From Single File** -> **To Feature Directory** (for reliable file operations)
2.  **From Markdown Lists** -> **To Structured YAML** (for reliable data parsing)
3.  **From In-Memory Parsing** -> **To `yq` CLI** (for atomic state updates)
4.  **From LLM Procedures** -> **To Helper Scripts** (for reliable procedural actions)

The solution is to isolate this procedural logic into simple, robust shell scripts. The LLM's role shifts from *performing* the procedure to *calling* the script that performs the procedure.

## The Script Execution Pattern (The "How")

A key challenge was executing these scripts, which are stored centrally, from any user directory. We established and validated the following pattern:

-   **Problem:** Scripts are located in `~/.gemini/commands/scripts/`, but session commands are executed from arbitrary project directories.
-   **Solution:** The LLM prompt will construct an absolute path to the script at runtime by leveraging the known conventional path for global user commands: `$HOME/.gemini/commands/`.

The command inside a prompt looks like this:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
COMMANDS_DIR="$HOME/.gemini/commands"
"$COMMANDS_DIR/scripts/your_script_name.sh" "arg1" "arg2"
```
This pattern is self-contained, requires no user setup (unlike a `setup.sh` script), and is resilient.

## Completed Work

This refactoring pattern has been successfully applied to several commands:

-   **/session:new**: Uses `scripts/create_feature_dir.sh` to scaffold the feature directory from a Shortcut story ID. The LLM's only file-writing task is to synthesize and write `description.md`.
-   **/session:checkpoint**, **/session:end**, and **/session:log-research**: These commands now use the `scripts/append_to_log.sh` script to add timestamped entries to the `log.md` file. This ensures consistent formatting and avoids race conditions or file corruption from a "Read-Append-Write" pattern being handled by the LLM.

## Future Refactoring Opportunities (TODO)

The following commands have been identified as candidates for future refactoring. The goal is to extract the procedural logic into dedicated helper scripts, making the commands more reliable and a single tool call.

### High Priority

-   **/session:migration**:
    -   **Current Logic:** The prompt contains a complex, multi-step procedure for reading an old markdown file, parsing it section by section, creating a new directory, creating multiple new files, converting content to YAML, and renaming the old file. This is extremely brittle for an LLM to perform directly.
    -   **Proposed Script:** `scripts/migrate_feature_file.sh`.
    -   **Implementation:** This script would accept the path to the old markdown file as an argument and handle the entire migration process internally. The LLM's only role would be to call this single script.

-   **/session:define**:
    -   **Current Logic:** The prompt instructs the LLM to generate a directory name, create a directory, and then create multiple placeholder files (`plan.yml`, `log.md`, etc.).
    -   **Proposed Script:** Reuse `scripts/create_feature_dir.sh`.
    -   **Implementation:** The LLM's role should be focused on the conversation to define the feature. Once approved, it should generate the directory name and call the `create_feature_dir.sh` script. The LLM's final step would be a single `write_file` call to create `description.md` with the synthesized content, mirroring the robust pattern used in `/session:new`.

### Medium Priority

-   **/session:start** & **/session:summary**:
    -   **Current Logic:** Both commands begin by reading all 5-6 files from the feature directory, one by one. This is inefficient and results in multiple tool calls.
    -   **Proposed Script:** `scripts/load_context_files.sh`.
    -   **Implementation:** This script would take the feature directory path as an argument, read all the context files (`description.md`, `plan.yml`, etc.), and print their contents to standard output, perhaps separated by a delimiter. The LLM could then get all context in a single, efficient tool call.

-   **/session:address-feedback**:
    -   **Current Logic:** The prompt uses a "Read-Append-Write" pattern to log the rationale for a fix to `log.md`.
    -   **Proposed Script:** Reuse `scripts/append_to_log.sh`.
    -   **Implementation:** The LLM should generate the summary of the feedback and the rationale, then call the script to append it to the log, just as `/session:checkpoint` does.

### Low Priority

-   **/session:pr**, **/session:pr_from_branch**, **/session:review**, & **/session:review_from_branch**:
    -   **Current Logic:** These prompts all involve running multiple `git` commands to get context (current branch name, main branch name, diff against main).
    -   **Proposed Script:** `scripts/get_git_context.sh`.
    -   **Implementation:** A single script could reliably gather all necessary git context and return it as a structured string (e.g., JSON), which the LLM can then use for generating the PR description or performing the code review. This would consolidate the logic and reduce the number of shell commands the LLM needs to invoke.
    -   **Future Consideration:** The output from `get_git_context.sh` is currently piped directly to the next command. For debugging or handling extremely large diffs, it might be beneficial to store this JSON output in a file within the feature directory (e.g., `git_context.json`). This would create a persistent artifact of the context used, but introduces the risk of the data becoming stale if not regenerated before each use. This is a trade-off to be evaluated later.

-   **/session:plan**:
    -   **Current Logic:** The LLM generates content for `plan.yml` and `questions.yml` and then uses two separate `write_file` calls to save them.
    -   **Proposed Script:** `scripts/write_plan_files.sh`.
    -   **Implementation:** A script could take the feature directory path and the content for both files as arguments, ensuring they are written in a single, atomic operation from the LLM's perspective.
