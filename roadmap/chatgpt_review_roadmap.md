# Session Workflow Commands -- Review and Recommendations

This document provides feedback and recommendations for the current
version of the **Session Workflow Commands** project.\
It analyzes the README and overall design philosophy, identifying
improvement opportunities, clarification needs, and potential
inconsistencies.

It also proposes a **future roadmap** for evolving the system into a
more robust AI-assisted engineering workflow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Improvements for the Current Version

## 1.1 Documentation Clarity Improvements

### Add a Workflow Overview [IMPLEMENTED]

The README explains commands individually but does not clearly show the
**end-to-end lifecycle of a session**.

A simple workflow diagram or lifecycle description would help new users
quickly understand the system.

Example lifecycle:

    define/new/start
        ↓
    plan
        ↓
    implement
        ↓
    checkpoint
        ↓
    review
        ↓
    address-feedback
        ↓
    pr
        ↓
    end

This would help readers understand how commands relate to each other.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Provide a Feature Directory Example [IMPLEMENTED]

The README explains the concept but does not show a concrete directory
example.

Example:

    .vscode/sc-12345/
        description.md
        plan.yml
        questions.yml
        log.md
        review.yml
        pr.md

This helps users visualize how the system is structured.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Document YAML Schemas [MISSING]

The README mentions structured YAML files but does not explain their
schema.

Examples should be included.

Example `plan.yml`:

``` yaml
tasks:
  - id: T1
    description: Create API endpoint
    status: todo

  - id: T2
    description: Add unit tests
    status: todo
```

Example `questions.yml`:

``` yaml
questions:
  - id: Q1
    question: Should the endpoint support pagination?
    status: open
```

Example `review.yml`:

``` yaml
findings:
  - id: R1
    severity: medium
    file: user_controller.ts
    description: Missing input validation
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Document Status Enums [MISSING]

The README references statuses but does not define them.

Statuses should be formally documented.

Example:

    todo
    done
    skipped
    open
    answered
    ignored

Explain when each status should be used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Clarify the Difference Between `/session:new` and `/session:define` [IMPLEMENTED]

The distinction may be confusing.

Suggested clarification:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Command                           Purpose
  --------------------------------- -------------------------------------
  `/session:new`                    Import an existing ticket (Shortcut
                                    story)

  `/session:define`                 Create a new user story based on
                                    codebase context
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Explicitly documenting this would reduce ambiguity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.2 Structural Improvements

### Separate Command Categories [MISSING]

Commands could be grouped by lifecycle stage:

**Feature Creation** - `/session:new` - `/session:define`

**Planning** - `/session:plan`

**Execution** - `/session:start` - `/session:checkpoint` -
`/session:log-research`

**Review** - `/session:review` - `/session:address-feedback`

**Delivery** - `/session:pr`

**Session Closure** - `/session:end`

**Utilities** - `/session:get-familiar` - `/session:summary` -
`/session:migration` - `/session:verify-release`

This improves readability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.3 Clarify the Subagent Pattern [IMPLEMENTED]

The README mentions the subagent pattern but does not fully explain:

-   when to use subagents
-   when not to use them
-   their performance benefits
-   their context isolation benefits

Adding a short explanation would help users understand the design
choice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.4 Clarify the Role of `GEMINI.md` [IMPLEMENTED]

The README describes `GEMINI.md` as **project memory**, but it would
help to clarify:

What types of knowledge belong there?

Examples:

-   architectural conventions
-   project rules
-   testing standards
-   recurring patterns

This helps maintain consistency across sessions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.5 Add a "Typical Usage Example" [IMPLEMENTED]

A step-by-step example would help readers understand the workflow.

Example:

    /session:new sc-12345
    /session:start sc-12345
    /session:plan
    ... implement feature ...
    /session:checkpoint
    /session:review
    /session:pr
    /session:end

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.6 Minor Ambiguities

### `.vscode` usage [ADDRESSED]

The README explains the reason for using `.vscode`, but this may confuse
users because:

-   `.vscode` is usually IDE-specific.
-   some developers commit it.

Possible alternatives:

    .features/
    .sessions/
    .dev/

This is not necessarily a required change, but worth noting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.7 Consistency Improvements [IMPLEMENTED]

Some command descriptions differ slightly in format and level of detail.

Standardizing each command description to include:

-   description
-   orchestration pattern
-   dependencies
-   inputs
-   outputs

would improve consistency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Future Roadmap

Using the current architecture as a baseline, the system could evolve
significantly.

## 2.1 Cross‑LLM Compatibility

Currently the workflow is tightly coupled to Gemini.

Future direction:

Create an **LLM‑agnostic architecture** where:

-   Gemini
-   Claude
-   other models

can execute the same commands.

This requires standardizing:

-   prompt contracts
-   artifact schemas
-   output formats

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.2 Session State Engine

The feature directory is already acting like a **state machine**.

Future improvement:

Add a formal **session state model**.

Example states:

    defined
    planned
    in_progress
    in_review
    feedback_addressed
    ready_for_merge
    completed

This would make automation easier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.3 Structured Knowledge Extraction

Research logs could feed into **project knowledge extraction**.

Example:

    research log
        ↓
    knowledge extraction
        ↓
    GEMINI.md update

This allows long-term learning from investigations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.4 Multi‑Agent Workflows

Subagents could evolve into specialized roles:

Examples:

-   code familiarizer
-   reviewer
-   test strategist
-   risk analyzer

Each agent would focus on a specific task.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.5 Improved Review Intelligence

Future review improvements:

-   acceptance criteria coverage check
-   regression risk analysis
-   architectural drift detection
-   missing test detection

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.6 Feature Knowledge Graph

The feature directory already forms a lightweight knowledge graph.

Future direction:

Link:

    tickets
    features
    files
    decisions
    questions
    reviews

This could allow powerful queries such as:

-   why was this change made?
-   which feature introduced this behavior?
-   what decision led to this architecture?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.7 Session Analytics

Add metrics for:

-   session duration
-   number of checkpoints
-   review findings
-   research effort

This can help improve development workflows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.8 Team Collaboration Mode

The system could evolve to support team usage.

Potential features:

-   shared session artifacts
-   multi-developer feature sessions
-   review collaboration
-   conflict detection

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.9 Automated Drift Detection

A future command could compare:

    ticket
    plan
    code
    review

to detect mismatches.

Example:

-   ticket requires X
-   code implements Y

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.10 Visualization Tools

Future additions:

-   feature session dashboards
-   feature progress graphs
-   dependency visualization

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Final Assessment

The project is already well designed and demonstrates:

-   strong separation of concerns
-   pragmatic use of LLMs
-   structured state management
-   workflow-driven development

With further documentation improvements and a roadmap toward multi-agent
workflows and cross‑LLM support, this system could evolve into a
**powerful AI-assisted engineering workflow framework**.
